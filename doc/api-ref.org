* Commands

A quick way to test commands is the use of the socat(1) tool:

: socat - unix-client:/var/run/payproc/daemon


** CARDTOKEN

Request a token for a card

Example:

#+begin_example
CARDTOKEN
Number: 4242424242424242
Exp-month: 8
exp-year: 2014
Cvc: 666
Name: Juscelino Kubitschek

OK
Token: tok_103rEw23ctCHxH4kTpC9BDTm
Last4: 4242
Live: f

#+end_example

Note that a request starts off with a command (here CARDTOKEN) and is
terminated by an empty line.  The response is either the "OK" or "ERR"
optionally followed by words on the line.  The response may then
consists of header lines and is terminated by a blank line.  Lines can
be continued on the next line by prefixing a continuation line with a
space.

The use of CARDTOKEN is not suggested - better use Stripe's
checkout Javascript to avoid handling sensitive card data on your
machine.  Having access to an unused card token, it is possible to
charge the card:

** CHARGECARD

#+begin_example
CHARGECARD
Card-Token: tok_103rEw23ctCHxH4kTpC9BDTm
Currency: USD
Amount: 17.50
Desc: OpenPGP card for use with GnuPG
Stmt-Desc: Openpgp card
Meta[name]: Juscelino Kubitschek
Meta[ship-to]: Pal√°cio da Alvorada
 70000 Brasilia
 Brazil

OK
_amount: 1750
Currency: usd
Live: f
Charge-Id: ch_103rEw23ctCHxH4ktmJ5na8N

#+end_example

An arbitrary number of Meta header lines may be used in the request,
they will all be written to the journal as key-value pairs.  An
example for an error return is:

#+begin_example
ERR 1 (General error)
failure: incorrect_number
failure-mesg: Your card number is incorrect.
Name: Juscelino Kubitschek

#+end_example

The "failure" data line contains a short description of the error.  It
may be returned to the user.  If a "failure-mesg" line is returned,
that may be returned verbatim to the user.  There is no guarantee that
a "failure" line will be preset.  However, the number after ERR is a
gpg-error error code and may be show to the user.  The description
after the number is usually the gpg_strerror of the error code but may
also be a more specific human readable string.

** CHECKAMOUNT

To convert an requested amount to the format used by Stripe, this
command can be used:

#+begin_example
CHECKAMOUNT
Amount: 17.3
Currency: Eur

OK
_amount: 1730
Currency: Eur
Amount: 17.3

#+end_example
