* Commands

A quick way to test commands is the use of the socat(1) tool:

: socat - unix-client:/var/run/payproc/daemon


** CARDTOKEN

Request a token for a card

Example:

#+begin_example
CARDTOKEN
Number: 4242424242424242
Exp-month: 8
exp-year: 2014
Cvc: 666
Name: Juscelino Kubitschek

OK
Token: tok_103rEw23ctCHxH4kTpC9BDTm
Last4: 4242
Live: f

#+end_example

Note that a request starts off with a command (here CARDTOKEN) and is
terminated by an empty line.  The response is either the "OK" or "ERR"
optionally followed by words on the line.  The response may then
consists of header lines and is terminated by a blank line.  Lines can
be continued on the next line by prefixing a continuation line with a
space.

The use of CARDTOKEN is not suggested - better use Stripe's
checkout Javascript to avoid handling sensitive card data on your
machine.  Having access to an unused card token, it is possible to
charge the card:

** CHARGECARD

#+begin_example
CHARGECARD
Card-Token: tok_103rEw23ctCHxH4kTpC9BDTm
Currency: USD
Amount: 17.50
Desc: OpenPGP card for use with GnuPG
Stmt-Desc: Openpgp card
Meta[name]: Juscelino Kubitschek
Meta[ship-to]: Pal√°cio da Alvorada
 70000 Brasilia
 Brazil

OK
_amount: 1750
Currency: usd
Live: f
Charge-Id: ch_103rEw23ctCHxH4ktmJ5na8N
_timestamp: 20140523T202551

#+end_example

An arbitrary number of Meta header lines may be used in the request,
they will all be written to the journal as key-value pairs.  An
example for an error return is:

#+begin_example
ERR 1 (General error)
failure: incorrect_number
failure-mesg: Your card number is incorrect.
Name: Juscelino Kubitschek

#+end_example

The "failure" data line contains a short description of the error.  It
may be returned to the user.  If a "failure-mesg" line is returned,
that may be returned verbatim to the user.  There is no guarantee that
a "failure" line will be preset.  However, the number after ERR is a
gpg-error error code and may be show to the user.  The description
after the number is usually the gpg_strerror of the error code but may
also be a more specific human readable string.

** CHECKAMOUNT

To convert an requested amount to the format used by Stripe, this
command can be used:

#+begin_example
CHECKAMOUNT
Amount: 17.3
Currency: Eur

OK
_amount: 1730
Currency: Eur
Amount: 17.3

#+end_example


** SESSION

This is a multipurpose command to help implement a state-full service.
Note that the state information is intentional not persistent and thus
won't survive a daemon restart.

The following sub-commands are available:

- Create a new session

  : create [TTL]

  A new session is created and the provided data dictionary is stored
  by payprocd for future requests.  The data dictionary is optional.
  On success the returned data has an "_SESSID" item which is to be
  used for all further requests.  If TTL has been given this is used
  instead of the defaul TTL value.

 - Destroy a session.

   : destroy SESSID

   This shall be used to free the internal storage required for the
   session and to avoid leaving sensitive information in RAM.

 - Get data from a session.

   : get SESSID

   Return the data stored in the session identified by SESSID.

 - Put data into a session.

   : put SESSID

   Store or update the given data in the session.  Deleting an item
   from the session dictionary is possible by putting an empty string
   for it.

** PPIPNHD

This command is used exclusively by the =ppipnhd= CGI to have payprocd
handle PayPal IPN requests.
