            Payproc - A local payment processor
           -------------------------------------

To run the daemon:

   payprocd --stripe-key /etc/payproc/stripe.testkey \
            --verbose --log-file /var/log/payproc/payprocd.log \
            --journal /var/log/payproc/journal

Payprocd creates the socket /var/run/payproc/daemon and expect the CA
root certificate in /etc/payproc/tls-ca.pem .  The given journal file
name will be suffixed with the current date and ".log".  The time
stamp in the journal is given in UTC.

You should also add a cron job for the payproc user to run
/usr/lib/payproc/geteuroxref each day at about 16:00 CET.

To add access restrictions to certain user ids in addition to the file
permissions of the communication socket, the options --allow-uids/-U
and --admin-uid may be used.  The take an UID or a username as
argument.  Setting an --admin-uid implicitly uses the uid for
--allow-uid.  If any UID has been specified payprocd check all
connections against this uids.  To use the admin-required commands
--admin-uid must have been given.  Thus a common list of options is
"-U www-data --admin-uid OPERATOR" to allow OPERATOR to make use of
all features.

See doc/api-ref.org for a description of supported commands.
